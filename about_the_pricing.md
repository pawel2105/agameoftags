This is for a blog post about the launch of the paid version.

3 different "accounts" that users can keep full:
  - searches
  - filters
  - activity points
  - XP

Users get 1 free search a day.
Users get 1 free filter a week.

Turn the entire site into a very themed game. Make it cutesy like that everywhere with tooltips and copy etc.

Users can top up their "accounts" by buying an equivalent of gems. They can also redeem filters and searches using activity points.

Prices for filters and searches:
  - 1 search = $0.99
  - 1 filter = $4.99

Activity points needed per purchase:
  - 1 search = 50 points
  - 1 filter = 150 points

Filters will include:
  - ability to exclude spam hashtags
  - ability to exclude own hashtags
  - have a slider for min and max amount of posts per hashtag to be considered in the results
  - another?

Users can perform tasks to get activity points. These activity points can be used to buy searches and filters. Example tasks can include:

  - Logging in once a day [5]
  - Logging in every day for a week [35](on top of the accumulated 35 from logging in daily)
  - Logging in every day for a month [350](on top of the accumulated 150 from logging in daily)
  - Tweeting something about AGOT, either positive or negative, their true opinion [25]
  - Blogging about AGOT [65]
  - Completing 100% of your profile [n]
  - Another user signed up using your referral link [n](per each user that signs up from this link)

XP acts as a multiplier. Levels and multipliers can be:
  - [lvl 1]: 1.1x activity points per completed task
  - [lvl 2]: 1.2x activity points per completed task
  - [lvl 3]: 1.3x activity points per completed task
  - [lvl 4]: 1.4x activity points per completed task
  - [lvl 5]: 1.5x activity points per completed task

(this model really lets us use almost the entire library of gamification tactics)

(filters are cheaper to buy using activity points - this is actually to let people think they've gamed the system but it's actually to get them to perform tasks. maybe make it something more subtle)

(users can connect their account to get activity points from tweeting - this can be visualized like a profile completeness naggy thing like on linkedin and it's visibly one of the outstanding items on the profile to-do)

(each user account should have a uuid generated on account creation used for referrals - accounts created using this referral landing page get credits to their activity points)
