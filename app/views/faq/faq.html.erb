        What kind of data does A Game of Tags provide?
      </div>

      <div class='faq-answer'>
        Our filter uses Instagram's API to fetch sets of related hashtags based on the input queries our users search with. It then does some calculations and provides the most relevant hashtags. It doesn't just provide the most relevant results, but accounts for the time of your search and will give you period-specific hashtags.

        What are period-specific hashtags?
      </div>

      <div class='faq-answer'>
        They are the hashtags that are most likely to be popular at the time of your search. For instance <span class='tag tag-inline'>#blue</span> might be a very popular hashtag on weekday mornings, but <span class='tag tag-inline'>#purple</span> is more popular in the evenings. Depending on when you search, our filter will provide you with results relevant to your search queries and your time of search.

        Why use period-specific hashtags?
      </div>

      <div class='faq-answer'>
        Not all hashtags are popular 100% of the time. Our aim is to find you the ones that are in fact popular at the time of your search. This will increase the chances of people coming across your image as they are exploring hashtags using their Instagram apps and the Instagram website. More exposure means that more people will be able to fall in love with your art!

        Is A Game of Tags free to use?
      </div>

      <div class='faq-answer'>
        Yes it is! However everyone is currently limited to a single search a day. We'll introduce premium accounts if there's any interest - this will help us add more server power so that our website won't explode due to search overload!

        Are results shown immediately?
      </div>

      <div class='faq-answer'>
        Sadly, no. Depending on how many search requests are being processed, your results may take a while to generate. It's kind of annoying, but there is an option to be notified via email when your hashtags are ready.
